1. Data Collection & Preprocessing: We used a dataset of leaf images from kaggle and preprocessed them to ensure quality inputs for our model.
2. Model Training: Using (Convolutional Neural Network) machine learning algorithms, we trained our model to recognize and classify various leaf diseases accurately.
3. Testing & Validation: Rigorous testing and validation were conducted to ensure the model's reliability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
4. Implementation: The final model demonstrated impressive accuracy, showcasing its potential to revolutionize crop management and disease prevention in agriculture.
